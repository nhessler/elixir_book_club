# *Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!* Reading Group

We're a group of elixir enthusiasts from the DC Metro area.
Our mission is to read and discuss _Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!_

The book can be found for free online [here][free-lyse]. A paper and ebook copy
are [also available][buy-lyse].

We're starting at a pace of 30ish pages/week;  we'll discuss the reading at
our weekly Hangout. Everyone is encouraged to take notes for each chapter.
Above, you'll see chapter folders; just create a markdown file with your name
and start writing. We'll rotate though meeting leaders, the person responsible
for facilitating the discussion and ensure that we don't spend too much time
complaining about javascript build tools.
