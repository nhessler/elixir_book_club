Elixir Book Club
================

We're a group of Elixir enthusiasts from the DC Metro area.
Our mission is to read and discuss books about Elixir and Erlang. By reading
together, we provide each other with greater accountability, motivation, and
insight into our reading and related projects.

If you're part of the group, talk to us in the group #book_ex slack channel.

If you're not (yet) a member, you can contact Nathan (gh: @nhessler |
slack: @hacknut) or Lee (@leesharma) for more information. Most of our members
can also be found in #elixir channel of [DCTech Slack], where this group
was born.
