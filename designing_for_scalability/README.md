# *Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP* Reading Group

We're a group of elixir enthusiasts from the DC Metro area.
Our mission is to read and discuss _Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP_.
This book was preceded by the first part of _Learn You Some Erlang_ for an
introduction to the Erlang syntax ([repo][lyse]).

[lyse]: ../learn_you_some_erlang

We're starting at a pace of one chapter/week;  we'll discuss the chapter at
our weekly Hangout. Everyone is encouraged to take notes for each chapter.
Above, you'll see chapter folders; just create a markdown file with your name
and start writing. We'll rotate though meeting leaders, the person responsible
for facilitating the discussion and ensure that we don't spend too much time
complaining about javascript build tools.
